Social media has grown to be a significant aspect of our lives in the modern world. Every day, we publish a huge amount of stuff, including both personal and professional information. Due to its marketing capabilities, it provides some with a source of revenue, while others use it as a platform to promote their material, speak out, and connect with the rest of the world. In reality, certain social media sites have evolved into arenas for politics. Consider the situation of Twitter, where many heads of state post updates. Numerous choices, thoughts, and events are communicated on these platforms. We are aware that social media has a problem because of its centralised form despite all of these factors.
